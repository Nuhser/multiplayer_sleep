**Requires [nuhser_core 4.0.0](https://github.com/Nuhser/nuhser_core/releases "Nuhser_Core") or newer to be installed first!**

Multiplayer Sleep sets the number of sleeping players required to skip the night to *50%* of all players online.

Alternatively you can use `/function multiplayer_sleep:toggle_single_player_sleep` to set the number of required players to *1*. You can toggle off this option with the same command.

It's also possible to tell the other players on the server that you don't want them to sleep by using the command `/trigger stop_sleeping`. This will stop everyone on the server from sleeping for **10 minutes**.
